# Default community files

This repo provides default files for any ansible-collections repository.

While there are few changes here, it is indirectly used by most repositories in this GitHub org.


See https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file for details.
