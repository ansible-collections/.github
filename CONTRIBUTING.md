# WELCOME TO ANSIBLE GITHUB

Hi! Nice to see you here!

## QUESTIONS ?

Please see the [Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html) for information on how to ask questions on the [mailing lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#mailing-list-information) and IRC.

The GitHub issue tracker is not the best place for questions for various reasons, but both IRC and the mailing list are very helpful places for those things, as the community page explains best.

## CONTRIBUTING ?

By contributing you agree that these contributions are your own (or approved by your employer) and you grant a full, complete, irrevocable copyright license to all users and developers of the project, present and future, pursuant to the license of the project.

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

You can read more about [Contributor License Agreements and the DCO](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/collection_contributors/collection_requirements.html#contributor-license-agreements) on the Ansible docsite.
